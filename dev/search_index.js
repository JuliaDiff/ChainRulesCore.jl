Importantly it is AD system agnostic. It has proved successful in this goal. At present it works with about half a dozen different JuliaLang AD systems. It has been a long journey, but as of August 2021, the core packages have now hit version 1.0.This talk will go through why this is useful, the particular objectives the project had, and the challenges that had to be solved. This talk is not intended as an educational guide for users (For that see our 2021 JuliaCon talk: > Everything you need to know about ChainRules 1.0 (https://live.juliacon.org/talk/LWVB39)).

Multiplying a complex number by i rotates it counter-clockwise by 90°. So the expression for dots takes a real number, Im(b), multiplies by s to make it parallel to s, then multiplies by i to make it perpendicular to s, that is, perfectly tangent to the unit complex circle at s.For the pullback, it again follows that only the real part of overlinel is pulled back.s^* rotates a number parallel to s to the real line. So s^* overlines rotates overlines so that its imaginary part is the part that was tangent to the complex circle at s, while the real part is the part that was not tangent.

There is currently no formal definition of what constitutes a natural tangent, but there are a few heuristics.

If not, then just add a unthunk after the start of your pullback.
